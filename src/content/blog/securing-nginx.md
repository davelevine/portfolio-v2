description: A guide to enhancing the security of Nginx configurations.

## Starting Line

A few weeks ago, I was reading an article on [Scott Helme's blog](https://scotthelme.co.uk/) about [caching Ghost with Nginx](https://scotthelme.co.uk/caching-ghost-with-nginx/). In doing this, I made this blog and a number of other services that I use kick into overdrive, but that whole endeavor is best left for its own article.

While reading that article, I noticed in the sidebar a service that he operates called [Security Headers](https://securityheaders.com/). Essentially, this measures measure how secure the headers of a web server are for a particular website. For kicks, I tried this site and my knowledge base; was I ever surprised by what I found.

Both sites came back with a sobering 'D' rating out of 'A' through 'F'. I wish I had taken a screenshot of this at the time to illustrate what I'm referring to, but unfortunately, I didn't.

These results were particularly concerning because I was under the assumption that I had secured not only the services pretty well, but also Nginx and Cloudflare. I realized quickly that I had a lot to learn.

## Re-evaluation

There were a number of resources I found about securing Nginx, but the problem was making it work for my environment. This was actually a lot harder than it may sound because I had to factor services like Cloudflare into the mix.

For example, I tried the following header that kept cropping up in my research, only to find out that it completely bypassed multi-factor auth:

`proxy_hide_header Set-Cookie;`

The breakdown of the `proxy_hide_header` is as follows:

> By default, nginx does not pass the header fields “Date”, “Server”, “X-Pad”, and “X-Accel-...” from the response of a proxied server to a client. The proxy_hide_header directive sets additional fields that will not be passed. If, on the contrary, the passing of fields needs to be permitted, the proxy_pass_header directive can be used.

Because the header was effectively being bypassed, it was breaking multi-factor auth. To be clear, I have multi-factor auth enabled through [Cloudflare Access](https://www.cloudflare.com/teams-access/) using [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) as the IdP.

## Trial and Error

The amount of trial and error that took place in all this was staggering, but I was finally able to narrow the new headers down to the following list:

* add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;
* add_header X-XSS-Protection “1; mode=block”;
* add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
* add_header Referrer-Policy “no-referrer”;
* add_header Feature-Policy strict-origin-when-cross-origin;
* add_header hide_server_tokens on;
* add_header Content-Security-Policy “default-src * data: 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'” always;

This gave me a nice balance between adding the additional security, while still retaining the performance benefits from the caching directives already put in place.

## Resources

For reference, the resources I used in order to make things work the way I wanted them to are as follows:

* <https://www.keycdn.com/blog/http-security-headers>
* <https://gist.github.com/plentz/6737338>
* <https://8gwifi.org/docs/nginx-secure.jsp>
* <https://www.keycdn.com/support..-security-policy>

## Finish Line

The problem with having this site password protected is that I can't get an accurate read on the headers; only an approximation. This is done by using my knowledge base as a comparison since the same headers and caching are used throughout the Nginx config file.

As you can see, my knowledge base headers are in great shape, which effectively means the headers for this blog are in great shape.

This was a good exercise to go through, even though I'm effectively the only traffic going to any of these sites. It's a good reminder that even if you think you've done enough to secure your services, there's always additional work to be done.
